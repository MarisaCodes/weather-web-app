# weather-web-app

- A very basic and simple weather app using openweathermap API.
- This would have been hell using XHR. I barely felt like I was doing Async because fetch is so nice and the boilerplate is friendly.
- It was a great learning experience overall despite my tiny bit lengthy app.js file.
